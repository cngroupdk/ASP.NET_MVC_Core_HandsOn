# Hands-on ASP.NET MVC Core 1.0

ASP.NET Core is multiplatform, so you will be able to follow as long as you meet the minimal requirements described below. No matter if you prefer OS X, Windows or Linux and develop in Sublime Text, Atom, VS Code, Notepad, Vim, Visual Studio or something else you can use any of those. As a matter of fact any text editor will do, but if you use one of the major ones, the experience will be more flawless for you. Same goes for your command line, anything will do, and you don't need any mad hacker skills, absolute basics are enough. 

Throughout the course I will spend some time in Visual Studio, but I will do all the coding in VS Code to make sure everybody can follow. **Full Visual Studio is not required for this course.**

### Installation steps:

1. Install DOT.NET Core from it's [official website](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core), [list of supported operating systems](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download). Please follow **all four steps**, to validate that you can in fact run DOT.NET Core on your system.
(Make sure to checkout the known workaround if you have `zsh` installed on OS X, or [this tutorial](http://donovanbrown.com/post/2016/05/29/Installing-NET-Core-RC2-on-Ubuntu-1604) for Ubuntu 16.06)

2. We will be using `npm` to manage packages. Install the current version of [node.js (v6.2.1)](node.js).

3. Install necessary npm packages globally. In an *administrator/sudo* command line run `npm install -g gulp bower yo generator-aspnet`.


4. *(optional)* To see exactly what I see, install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). 
If you prefer other editor, check out [OmniSharp](http://www.omnisharp.net) which provides code completion (IntelliSense) in multiple major text editors such as [Atom](http://atom.io) or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3). 


See you soon!
